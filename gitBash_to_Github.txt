------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Always use commands without dollar ($) sign

## First time official doc for setting up git bash to Github
## Read about credential.helper wincred on stackoverflow
https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git

On gitBash as default I can access git using this line (see below):
$ cd "/c/program files/git" # this is gitBash root direction (non-local neither non-remote directory)

On gitBash to check current location being set use this line (see below):
$ pwd
# gitBash output: /c/program files/git

On gitBash to set local directory for gitHub account follow those three lines one by one (see below):
cd
ls
cd Desktop # from now one local directory is Desktop

Next step to follow on gitBash is authentication via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/reposit96/<custom_repository_name>.git 
# <custom_repository_name>, in this is case is gitRepo created before cloning procedure being done.

Next step to follow on gitBash is:
git init
# Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Lukas_G/Desktop/.git/

Add README.md follow:
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/reposit96/gitRepo.git
git push -u origin master
# When open gitRepo in gitHub you can see README.md created remotely via gitBash

Now to add, delete and do other sort of things follow that:
