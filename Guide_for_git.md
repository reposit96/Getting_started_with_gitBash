# Git bash always stars with dollar sign so no dollar sign is presented before commands
## Most often used symbols: ``` ~ | $ | <#> ```

### First step is we need to get in touch with Github. For now I have already created a repo (repository) called "new_repo" on Github
### The second below command shows on how to connect to new_repo:
``` git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git (*only for syntaxical purposes*) ```
``` git clone https://github.com/reposit96/new_repo.git ``` everything is fine.

### Second step is to initialize .git files to your local repository by using this command shown below:
``` git init ``` unless it's already been initiliazed we will get a message for reinitialization being made upon. It's okay no worries!

### Third step is git bash straight away from local repository or follow command below:
``` cd ~/My-Github-Project/new_repo ```
### In order to show files files and (or) folders (to get know better what files are you working with), follow command below:
``` git ls-files ``` if no files is shown it might be due to files not been added (added, tracked, staged â€“ all're synonyms) yet. Otherwise it's empty local_repository
### We allways have to track first using  ``` $ git add ``` command, then by tracking we prepare file(s) or/and folders for staging (stage)
[Stackoverflow: difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/572549/difference-between-git-add-a-and-git-add) | **Rule of the thumb**: *First TRACK then STAGE*

### Fourth step. When all files and folders staged (tracked, added, cached) we have to commit in order to show possible changes being made  upon, to do so follow command below:
``` git commit -m "First commit" ```
### In order to follow commits being done follow command below:
``` git diff --cached ``` (--cahed and --staged *are synonyms*). Otherwise just do: ``` git diff ```
### In some particular context for commits the following command might also be useful:
``` git status -v ```
### Add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:
``` git remote add origin <remote repository URL> ```
### Verifies the new remote URL
``` git remote -v ```
### When it's verified we are ready to push
``` git push origin master ``` | If any errors displayed, follow this link [https://superuser.com/questions/1412078/bring-a-local-folder-to-remote-git-repo]
