# Git bash always stars with dollar sign so no dollar sign is presented before commands
## Most often used symbols: ``` ~ | $ | <#> ```

### First step is we need to get in touch with Github. For now I have already created a repo (repository) called "new_repo" on Github.
### The second below command shows on how to connect to new_repo:
``` git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git (*only for syntaxical purposes*) ```
``` git clone https://github.com/reposit96/new_repo.git ``` everything is fine.

### Second step is to initialize .git files to your local repository by using this command shown below:
``` git init ``` unless it's already been initiliazed we will get a message for reinitialization being made upon. It's okay no worries!

### Third step is git bash straight away from local repository or follow command below:
``` cd ~/My-Github-Project/new_repo ```
### In order to show files files and (or) folders (to get know better what files are you working with), follow command below:
git ls-files # if no files is shown it might be due to files not been added (added, tracked, staged â€“ all're synonyms) yet. Otherwise it's empty local_repository
### We allways have to track first using  ``` $ git add ``` command, then by tracking we prepare file(s) or/and folders for staging (stage)
